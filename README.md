## __Why it is interesting:__ 
I found this article interesting because it showed how easily even big companies like Starbucks can leave themselves vulnerable to attack and exploitation from one simple mistake. Every time I have seen an API key it is always stressed that they should be kept totally secret. Not only was this not kept very secret, but it was left in a public Github repo, which is interesting as it ties in with this very assignment. The other part of the article I found interesting was that companies offer bounties for people to test and discover vulnerabilities in their systems. I had not thought about it before, but that kind of offer makes sense, as even the most extensive testing can leave edge case scenarios undiscovered.

## __Why I put this link: __
cybersecurity and cryptography is becoming more and more important as the web holds most of our personal data. One of the most common cryptography used by companies is SHA family, a secure hash algorithm. SHA-1 was a popular choice for a while until it became obsolete and imporvement have been made over the years by increasing the size. Most company seem to lack proper protection for data they manage such as username, password which would lead to phone number, bank account, SSN, and much more. Therefore I believe cybersecurity is an interesing topic to look into.
